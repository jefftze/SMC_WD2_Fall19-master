                            <p>Those fashion designers are just crazy; but aren't we all? Women are women, and hurray for that. I design from instinct. It's the only way I know how to live. What feels good. What feels right. What is needed. Give me a problem and I will approach it creatively, from my gut. It is difficult to talk about fashion in the abstract, without a human body before my eyes, without drawings, without a choice of fabric - without a practical or visual reality.

                            <p>Beauty is perfect in its imperfections, so you just have to go with the imperfections. War taught me that not everything is glamorous. Fashion is made to become unfashionable. You have to be luxurious nude. It's difficult to move in the nude in front of a mirror. It's much easier to move when you're dressed. But if you can walk around in the nude easily in front of your man, if you can be luxurious in the nude, then you've really got it. Beauty is perfect in its imperfections, so you just have to go with the imperfections.

                            <p>Attitude is everything. I have an obsession with details and pattern. I am never satisfied with myself and that is what keeps me going - I have no post-satisfaction. I am like a freight train. Working on the details, twisting them and playing with them over the years, but always staying on the same track. You can't just buy things for the label - it's ridiculous.
